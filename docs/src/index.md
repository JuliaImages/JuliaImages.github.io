# JuliaImages: image processing and machine vision for Julia

JuliaImages ([source code](https://github.com/JuliaImages)) hosts the
major [Julia](http://julialang.org/) packages for image processing.
Julia is well-suited to image processing because it is a modern and
elegant high-level language that is a pleasure to use, while also
allowing you to write "inner loops" that compile to efficient machine
code (i.e., it is as fast as C).  Julia supports multithreading and,
through add-on packages, GPU processing.

JuliaImages is a collection of packages specifically focused on image
processing.  It is not yet as complete as some toolkits for other
programming languages, but it has many useful algorithms.  It is
focused on clean architecture and is designed to unify "machine
vision" and "biomedical 3d image processing" communities.

These pages are designed to help you get started with image analysis
in Julia.

    Please help improve this documentation--if something confuses you, chances
    are you're not alone. It's easy to do as you read along: just click on the
    "Edit on GitHub" link above, and then

    Your changes will be vetted by developers before becoming permanent, so don't
    worry about whether you might say something wrong.
